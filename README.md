# Personal Website

A biographical website about Raphael Deonova, which is made using React and, as for now, styled using Bootstrap.

### Site architecture
This site will include:
- Academics
- Projects
- Background story


## Cloning
To start a development server, type\
`npm start`
>tip: have Node.js and react installed in your workspace. I would even recommend to install those globally as it is quite helpful.
